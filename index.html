          You can go to <Strong>Mars</Strong>, <Strong>Jupiter</Strong>, <strong>Neptune</strong> and . Once you
          select
          your simulation of choice, you will
          then have to prepare for your simulation by selecting supplies such as sleeping, clothing and
          hygiene necessities, transportation method, and a few optional equipments you may find necessary for
          survival.
          Once you've finished prep, you will then be transported to you planet of choice via simulation. The
          simulation
          will
          last anywhere from 2-3 months depending on which planet you choose. Each planet has it's share of
          difficulties,
          including extraterrestrial entities.

          would
          consider out of touch.
