            select
            your simulation of choice, you will
            then have to prepare for your simulation by selecting supplies such as sleeping, clothing and
            hygiene necessities, transportation method, and a few optional equipments you may find necessary for
            survival.
            Once you've finished prep, you will then be transported to you planet of choice via simulation. The
            simulation
            will
            last anywhere from 2-3 months depending on which planet you choose. Each planet has it's share of
            difficulties,
            including extraterrestrial entities.

            would
